-- Some problem in project: --
- [X] Folder main.jsx: It represents the main root of the project => Best practice for using this file: Write context in it
- [ ] Folder app.jsx: It represents also main root after main.jsx => Best practice for using this file: Write <Header /> & <Footer /> or any component you want be present on all page


-- Tasks --
- [X] Using react-route-dom: for the purpose of routing in react 
- [X] Remove any component from app.jsx and just write route in it 
  For Example => 
    <!-- function App() {
      return (
        <>
          <Header /> 
          <div>
            <Routers>
              <Router path='/AdminPanel' element={<AdminPanel />}>
              <Router path='/Categories' element={<Categories />}>
              <Router path='/Items' element={<Items />}>
            </Routers>
          </div>
          <Footer />
        </Footer>
  );
} -->
