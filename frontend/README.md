# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Creating an e-commerce website like "LapShop" involves a structured approach to handle both the front-end and back-end components. Here's a breakdown of the tasks:

1. Project Planning and Requirements
Task 1: Define project scope and key requirements (e.g., product pages, shopping cart, payment gateway, admin dashboard).
Task 2: Design user flows and wireframes for each section.
Task 3: Select a tech stack (e.g., React or Vue for front-end, Node.js or Django for back-end, MongoDB or MySQL for database).
2. Database and Back-end Setup
Task 4: Design database schema (e.g., Users, Products, Orders, Categories).
Task 5: Set up a server (using Express, Django, etc.) and connect it to the database.
Task 6: Develop API endpoints for:
User authentication (sign up, log in, log out)
Product listing, search, and filters
Shopping cart (add, update, remove items)
Order management (create, track, update status)
Admin functions (add/edit products, manage users, track orders)
Task 7: Implement secure payment integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
3. Front-end Development
Task 8: Set up front-end framework (e.g., create React or Vue project).
Task 9: Create reusable UI components:
Navigation bar
Product cards and product detail pages
Cart and checkout pages
User account and profile pages
Task 10: Develop a responsive layout to ensure compatibility with mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Task 11: Integrate API with front-end for dynamic data fetching (products, user data, etc.).
Task 12: Implement shopping cart functionality (e.g., updating cart total, applying discounts).
Task 13: Set up order confirmation and tracking views.
4. Admin Dashboard
Task 14: Create the admin dashboard to manage:
Product inventory (CRUD operations)
Order tracking and management
User management and permissions
Task 15: Implement analytics view to track sales, users, and product performance.
5. User Authentication and Authorization
Task 16: Implement authentication (OAuth, JWT, etc.) with roles (admin, user).
Task 17: Set up password reset and email verification features.
Task 18: Add authorization checks for admin-only and user-only pages.
6. Testing and Debugging
Task 19: Perform unit and integration tests for API endpoints.
Task 20: Test front-end components for UX/UI issues across devices.
Task 21: Conduct security tests (e.g., CSRF, XSS, SQL injection).
7. Deployment and Launch
Task 22: Set up hosting (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for front-end and back-end.
Task 23: Configure domain and SSL certificate.
Task 24: Optimize performance (e.g., compress images, lazy load components).
Task 25: Launch the website and monitor for any post-launch issues.
8. Maintenance and Updates
Task 26: Implement user feedback collection.
Task 27: Regularly update security patches and dependencies.
Task 28: Add new features based on analytics and user feedback.
